# Sky Dome
Skydome project written to test out a spherical coordinate method to generate vertices.

# Summary
This was a small project to render a spherical dome using a spherical coordinate system to
calculate the vertices. The final result had a really cool looking interior cylinder so I left it.
Please note that I used Neheâ€™s base code framework for this project so I didnâ€™t have to take extra
time making my own base.
